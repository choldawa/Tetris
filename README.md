# Tetris
Future project focusing on construction tasks. 
Borrowing base structure from https://github.com/melcor76/js-tetris/tree/blog.

The goal of this project will be to explore how people plan and use heuritics when placing blocks in a tetris environment. Once we have quantified this behavior in solo and partner trials, we will develop artificial agents that can exploit these consistencies to better collaborate with human partners.
